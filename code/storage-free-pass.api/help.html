<h1>Usage</h1>

Create an HTML file and reference the script “API.js” in the <code>head</code> element:

<pre lang="JavaScript">
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;script&gt; src="../storage-free-pass.api/API.js"&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
</pre>

In the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element, add a single script. It should define the function <code>const userData = () => {/*...*/};</code> and return the structure of the user accounts. For example:

<pre>
"use strict";

const userData = () => {

   const defaultPasswordLength = 16;
   const testCharacterRepertoire = "1234567890ABCDDEFG";
   const strongCharacterRepertoire = "!#$%&()+-0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[]^abcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz|~/";
      
   return {
      metadata: { title: `User Data Sample ${String.fromCodePoint(0x1f9e1)}`, version: "1.0.0", },
      accounts: [
         {
            identity: {
               seed: "Test",
               selection: { characterRepertoire: testCharacterRepertoire, start: 0, length: 8, shift: 0 }
            },
            display: { name: "Test" }
         },
         {
            identity: {
               seed: "Real account 2020/02/14",
               selection: { characterRepertoire: strongCharacterRepertoire, start: 0, length: 24, shift: 0 }
            },
            display: { group: "$", name: "Real Account", user: { name: "user", url: "./redirect-demo/accounts.html" } }
         },
      ], // accounts    
      default: {
         identity: {
            seed: "ERROR! define seed!",
            selection: { characterRepertoire: strongCharacterRepertoire, start: 0, length: defaultPasswordLength, shift: 0 }
         },
         display: { name: "Incomplete account", url: "https://www.undefined.account", user: { name: "unknown user", url: String.empty } }
      },
   };
   
};</pre>

<details open="true">
    <summary>metadata</summary>
    <details>  
        <summary>title</summary>
        <p>Title string representing the user's account set. It is displayed as the browser's page/tab title and the title of the account selector.</p>
    </details>
    <details>  
        <summary>version</summary>
        <p>Optional string representing version of the user's account set, if defined, shown in  the title of the account selector.</p>
    </details>
</details>
<details open="true">
    <summary>accounts</summary>
    <p>Array of account objects. Each object in the array has the same structure as <code>default</code>,
        which is used to populate <code>undefined</code> members of each account structure, so, all members of each account are formally optional.
        For explanation of account object members, see <code>default</code> below.
        However, three members are practically essential in all cases:
    </p>
    <details>
        <summary>identity.seed</summary>
        <p>This field is critically important and should be unique. Combined with master password, it is used for generation of cryptographic hash.
            If an account password has to be changed, some part of <code>seed</code> should be modified, otherwise new password will be the same as old one,
            or made different only due to the changes in <code>selection</code>, which would be not safe enough.
            It's a good idea to include date or date/time of the new password creation in the <code>seed</code> string.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>display.name</summary>
        <p>This name is used for UI navigation using the list box on left.
            Besides, it is shown on top of the account table, which also can be used as an anchor, if <code>display.url</code> is defined.</code></p>

                    form.

                    less

                <p>Inserts member is used to work around the problem with the sites with some special password rules.
                    For example, some rules require the presense of at least one character of each of several character
                    sets.
                    To meed such criteria, some fixed character sequences can be <i>inserted</i> into the automatically
                    generated password string in different positions. This is an object with the structure shown below, or and array of such objects:</p>
                <details>

<h2 id="custom-crypto">Custom Cryptosystem</h2>

<p>Optionally, the user can provide a custom cryptosystem:</p>

<pre lang="JavaScript">
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;script data-crypto="../storage-free-pass.api/crypto.js" src="../storage-free-pass.api/API.js"&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
</pre>

The file “crypto.js” can be any file used to replace the file “storage-free-pass.api/crypto.js”. If should implement the same functionality and define the function <code>const passwordGenerator = (() => {/* ... */}</code>.

The file is found by the attribute <code>script</code> attribute <code>data-crypto</code>. If this attribute is not defined, the default file “storage-free-pass.api/crypto.js” is used.
