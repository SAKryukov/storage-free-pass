<h1>User Data</h1>

<p>The use can fill in account information in the file "userData.js". Let's consider the following example with only one account defined:</p>

<pre>
"use strict";

const userData = () => {

   const defaultPasswordLength = 16;
   const testCharacterRepertoire = "1234567890ABCDDEFG";
   const strongCharacterRepertoire = "!#$%&()+-0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[]^abcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz|~/";
      
   return {
      metadata: { title: `${String.fromCodePoint(0x1F642)} User` },
      accounts: [
         {
            identity: {
               seed: "Test",
               selection: { characterRepertoire: testCharacterRepertoire, start: 0, length: 8, shift: 0 }
            },
            display: { name: "Test" }
         },
         {
            identity: {
               seed: "Real account 2020/02/14",
               selection: { characterRepertoire: strongCharacterRepertoire, start: 0, length: 24, shift: 0 }
            },
            display: { group: "$", name: "Real Account", user: { name: "user", url: "./redirect-demo/accounts.html" } }
         },
      ], // accounts    
      default: {
         identity: {
            seed: "ERROR! define seed!",
            selection: { characterRepertoire: strongCharacterRepertoire, start: 0, length: defaultPasswordLength, shift: 0 }
         },
         display: { name: "Incomplete account", url: "https://www.undefined.account", user: { name: "unknown user", url: String.empty } }
      },

<h2 id="account-members">Account Members</h2>

<details open="true">
    <summary>metadata</summary>
    <details>  
        <summary>title</summary>
        <p>Title string representing the user's account set. It is displayed as the browser's page/tab title and the title of the account selector.</p>
    </details>
    <details>  
        <summary>version</summary>
        <p>Optional string representing version of the user's account set, if defined, shown in  the title of the account selector.</p>
    </details>
</details>
<details open="true">
    <summary>accounts</summary>
    <p>Array of account objects. Each object in the array has the same structure as <code>default</code>,
        which is used to populate <code>undefined</code> members of each account structure, so, all members of each account are formally optional.
        For explanation of account object members, see <code>default</code> below.
        However, three members are practically essential in all cases:
    </p>
    <details>
        <summary>identity.seed</summary>
        <p>This field is critically important and should be unique. Combined with master password, it is used for generation of cryptographic hash.
            If an account password has to be changed, some part of <code>seed</code> should be modified, otherwise new password will be the same as old one,
            or made different only due to the changes in <code>selection</code>, which would be not safe enough.
            It's a good idea to include date or date/time of the new password creation in the <code>seed</code> string.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>display.name</summary>
        <p>This name is used for UI navigation using the list box on left.
            Besides, it is shown on top of the account table, which also can be used as an anchor, if <code>display.url</code> is defined.</code></p>

    </details>
</details>

<details open="true">
    <summary>default</summary>
    <p>All members of default are mandatory and should not be assigned to <code>undefined</code>. They represent account
        data used to fill in all undefined members of each account:</p>
    <details>
        <summary>identity</summary>
        <p>Set of parameters which uniquely determine the content of the password string, depending on master password:

        <details>
            <summary>seed</summary>
            <p>Seed string used for cryptographic hash generation. The hash is generated from a master password and

                <p>Character repertoire string used to represent part of generated cryptographic hash array in textual
                    form.
                    A password string will be composed from the characters taken from character repertoire and also
                    those
                    found in <code>inserts</code>.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>start</summary>
                <p>Starting index in the cryptographic hash array. This is an integer value which doesn't have to be
                    less
                    than the size of the array.</p>

                <summary>shift</summary>
                <p>Integer representing shift in the character repertoire. This index doesn't have to be less then the

                <summary>inserts</summary>
                <p>Inserts member is used to work around the problem with the sites with some special password rules.
                    For example, some rules require the presense of at least one character of each of several character
                    sets.
                    To meed such criteria, some fixed character sequences can be <i>inserted</i> into the automatically
                    generated password string in different positions. This is an object with the structure shown below, or and array of such objects:</p>
                <details>
                    <summary>value</summary>
                    <p>String value of the text to be inserted in the password string.</p>

                    <summary>position</summary>
                    <p>Optional position of the text to be inserted in the password string. If this value exceeds the length of
                        current password string, the <code>value</code> is appended. If this value is negative, the
                        position is counted from the end of the current password string. If it is not defined, it is equivalent to position 0.</p>

    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>display</summary>
        <p>Set of parameters which do not affect the content of the password string. The only member which affects login
            is
            <code>user.name</code>. All the members are used for the presentation of account data in UI:</p>
        <details>
            <summary>name</summary>
            <p>Display name of the account, used in the navigation list box and in the header of the account table.</p>

        <details>
            <summary>group</summary>
            <p>Optional string representing a group of accounts shown in the account selector. Note that grouping can re-order accounts, as accounts with the same group name are grouped together. The accounts for which the group is not defined are placed on top of the list.</p>

                logon is
                clearly visible. If URL is defined, the header of the account table becomes an anchor used to navigate
                to
                the authentication page.</p>

<h1>Redirect API</h1>

<p>SHA-2 Password Generator can be used as is, if the user edits the file "userData.js", as if it was a part of the application. However, this would be utterly inconvenient, especially when a new version of the application is pulled from its Git repository; then the user would either support a separate copy of all files, resolve conflicts, and so on. It would also be difficult to support more than one set of accounts.<p>

<p>Redirect API is the way to have a separate user data file with a separate HTML file, which would launch the application through redirection, supplying a separate user data file as a parameter.<p>

<p>Let's consider the example shown in the directory "redirect-demo", placed as a sub-directory of the application directory, with the user data file "accounts.js". Then a near-minimal HTML file can look like this:</p>

<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;script src="../redirectAPI.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;redirectAPI.redirect("../index.html", { userData: "./redirect-demo/accounts" } );&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>Note that the paths in "accounts.js" are still the paths relative to the application directory. In practice, the user-supplied files should be placed anywhere outside of the application directory.</p>
